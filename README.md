# Customer-Analytics
This is a part of my MSIM coursework and learnt different marketing strategies and techniques used.

This repository includes implementation of RFM model to pitch marketing to valued customers. It also includes the implementation of recommendation system using Collaborative filtering approach and Amazon approach. I have also added some code sample in R for performing logistic and linear regression.
